# Bioinformatic-thesis-project
A research project that quantifies individual contributions to the global effort to track coronavirus variants in Python. The accession number and contributor information were obtained by PDF extraction and from the GISAID database through web API requests. A relational database was designed and populated with the pre-processed data linking contributors to research outputs. The database was used to develop individual level metrics that can provide an informative measure of data velocity and quantify an individualâ€™s contribution to the overall flow of information.
